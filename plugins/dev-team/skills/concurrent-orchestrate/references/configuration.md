## Configuration

### `concurrency.max-parallel-tasks` — integer

The repo-wide cap on concurrently active task-pipeline spawns, enforced internally by
`concurrent_schedule.py` (via `get-project-configuration`'s merged config) — never something
this skill's own prose reads or reasons about directly. Counts only active (non-terminal)
`workflow-orchestrate` spawns tracked across every `concurrent-<target-slug>.json` file under
this repo's state directory — never a `dev-team:monitor-prs` monitor, which is idle almost all
the time it's running. Defaults to `3`; override in `.dev-team/config.yaml` for a machine with more
(or less) headroom for parallel agent sessions:

```yaml
concurrency:
  max-parallel-tasks: 5
```
